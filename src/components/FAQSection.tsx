                Our solar panels are designed to last over 25 years with minimal reduction in efficiency. All components come with respective warranties (5, 10, or 25 years depending on your plan). If any part malfunctions within the warranty period, we'll repair or replace it at no additional cost. Beyond the warranty, we offer affordable maintenance and repair services.

                Yes! All our systems are designed with scalability in mind. You can add more panels or increase battery capacity as your needs grow. The Premium plan is especially designed for easy expansion. Our technicians can assess your current setup and recommend the most cost-effective way to increase your system's capacity.

              <AccordionContent className="px-6 pb-4 text-gray-300">
                Our solar systems are designed to perform in various weather conditions. While sunny days produce the most power, our panels still generate electricity on cloudy days, just at a reduced capacity (typically 10-25% of rated output). The battery storage component ensures you have power even during extended periods of bad weather. Our systems are also built to withstand heavy rain, wind, and hail.

              <AccordionContent className="px-6 pb-4 text-gray-300">
                From the time you place an order, the typical timeline is 2-3 weeks for assessment and scheduling, followed by 1-2 days for actual installation. Basic and Standard systems can often be installed in a single day, while Premium systems might take 1-2 days depending on complexity. After installation, we conduct thorough testing and provide you with a complete walkthrough of your new system.
